## How do you do?! ðŸ‘¾
### Pleased to meet you, my name's Iris!
- I'm about to start my new job, I'll start to work with SAP ABAP.
- It will be my first job in the IT area, and I'm really excited about it.
- I have a lot of things to learn yet, but I enjoy learning new things!
- I'm currently studying Analysis and Systems Development.
PS: and an English Course too!

I hope to share something useful here and also learn from other people too.

Seja bem-vindo(a)! â˜„ðŸŒ±
